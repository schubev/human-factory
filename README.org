#+TITLE: Human factory

This browser extension for Firefox and Google Chrome makes filling
forms with random data a breeze! Focus a field, and press
~Alt+Shift+J~ (~Ctrl+J~ on OS X). The extension will detect the kind
of value the field expects (first name, last name, phone numberâ€¦) and
fill it accordingly.

This is still under active development. Amongst the quirks and missing
features are:

- random phone numbers are always in french mobile format
  (+33782XXXXXXXX)
- birthdates are always in french format (DD/MM/YYYY)
- adress, zipcode, city and country fields are unsupported
- fields are filled with unrelated data
- no mechanism for configuration currently
